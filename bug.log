1./mode #channel -o user1
This crashes when user1 already lost the channel operator position and I try it again.
->OK

2./join channel
When #channel is invite-only and the user got kicked out, the user can join back without a new invite.
->OK

3./topic #channel "new topic"
The channel's topic becomes ["new] instead of [new topic].
->OK

4./join channel1,channel2 key1,key2
(channel1's password is [key1], channel2's password is [key2])
The user can access channel1 but not channel2, and even after trying [/join channel2 key2],
the user cannot join channel2 even after disabling password protection on channel2.
