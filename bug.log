4./join channel1,channel2 key1,key2
(channel1's password is [key1], channel2's password is [key2])

the user cannot join channel2 even after disabling password protection on channel2.

14.(Is it an issue?)/When joining a channel, if a topic was previously defined, the new user won't see it.
Same goes for mode changes: If mode +i was applied previously and a new user joins, then mode +t is applied,
the old user will see #chan(+it) and the new user will see #chan(+t).
