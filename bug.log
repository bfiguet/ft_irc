2./join channel
When #channel is invite-only and the user got kicked out, the user can join back without a new invite.
->fixed by bfiguet
2B(bug or feature?)/Two invites in a row from user1 to user2 allow user2 to join back in an invite-only channel after being kicked without needing a new invite one time only.

3./topic #channel "new topic"
The channel's topic becomes ["new] instead of [new topic].

4./join channel1,channel2 key1,key2
(channel1's password is [key1], channel2's password is [key2])
The user can access channel1 but not channel2, and even after trying [/join channel2 key2],
the user cannot join channel2 even after disabling password protection on channel2.

4B.Trying with three channels triggers a 476 #chan2,#chan3 Bad Channel Mask message, and the channels 2 and 3 are inaccessible even by trying them one by one.

4C.
Trying to join three channels with only the first right: joining chan1 but not chan2 and 3.
Then trying the same command but with the first two being right: joining chan1 (already joined) and chan2 but not 3.
Then trying with all three being right allows access to chan3, but doesn't show the log like on the first two.

14.(Is it an issue?)/When joining a channel, if a topic was previously defined, the new user won't see it.
Same goes for mode changes: If mode +i was applied previously and a new user joins, then mode +t is applied,
the old user will see #chan(+it) and the new user will see #chan(+t).
